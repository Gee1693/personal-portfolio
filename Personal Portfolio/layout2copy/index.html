<!--Comments from teacher with issues to correct

The search at the top of the page needs some adjustments. The Go button still has some browser default styling to remove and the search box should not have an outline on hover.

Be sure to self-terminate all link tags and input tags.

The "jump link" behavior is puzzling; check the solution and see if tweaking your CSS to match that solves the issue.

Various other focus-related items: the outline around the logo should be white, not black (to improve contrast), when the search box gets focus there is a lot of space to the left of the cursor, the outlines around the plus icons are huge (which means that active clickable area for the plus icons is also massive), and the 'Travel Smart' items should invert their colors on focus and hover.

The 'Travel Smart' items should also have their text centered.

The Join button has browser defaults still in effect; those need to be removed and new styles applied in their place.

Your layout is triggering a horizontal scrollbar on body from 800px to 1100px.  This is almost always due to something having a fixed width that is going off the right edge of the viewport. It's a common concern with responsive design and something to always watch for.  On a Mac it isn't as obvious as on a PC, because the horizontal scrollbar is smaller and less obvious.

At the smaller window sizes the blockquote needs to be allowed to expand wider; it is so smushed that the text is limited to 2-3 words per line.

Always try to describe the photos when writing an aria-label or an alt attribute. "Greek Tours homepage image" is not descriptive of what the photo shows.

The blockquote tag should be around the text of the quotation.  No need for a heading there, and in the big picture of things that text isn't a heading for anything else, so a heading is not appropriate.

Do not use redundant aria-labels.  This is happening with anchors where there is visible text and it matches the aria-label.  Remove the aria-labels in those cases.  aria-labels are critical in only two situations: unlabeled form elements and background images.  They have some value for nav tags as well, and your nav tag could use one.-->





<!--Layout 2 Specifications-->
<!--Summary
You are coding the home page for Go Greek Tours.
This layout uses the material covered in Modules 4 - 6.
The layout is to be built primarily with grid, with a small amount of positioning.
Internet Explorer will not be happy with this layout, because we are using grid (and not their non-standard syntax for it) and WEBP for most images, but it should render consistently in all the other browsers identified in the course syllabus.
Basic Setup
Create an HTML5 page named index.html
All of your CSS is to be in a single external file.
You will also be bringing in Web Fonts from Google. Here is the code:
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Arima+Madurai:wght@400;700&family=Roboto+Slab:wght@400;700&family=Roboto:wght@400&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" />
As always, be sure to include the self-terminated preconnect link tags as well.
The containing element is 1000px at its widest.
Breakpoints exist at 1010px, 800px, and 600px.
Keep in mind that headings come with default margins that you may need to set to 0.
Every anchor in this layout should be set to "#".
Text is #000, unless noted otherwise.
The images you are to use in this layout are in an attached zip archive. Do not modify these images; they are to be used as provided. They are a mixture of WEBP and PNG; I found that converting the PNGs to WEBP was not necessary, as the PNG images were already smaller than 1 HTTP packet.
Background images (the WEBP format graphics) should be set to cover and should be placed top center.
The default font settings are 400 font weight, 14px tall, 1.3 line-height, and Roboto, sans-serif.
The vertical spacing amounts in these specifications reflect the values I used. Depending on your code setup and the extra space you are picking up from default margins (for example), you may need to adjust the values to match the video and screenshots (or track down the extra space from padding and/or margin and eliminate it). Your goal is to match the video and the screenshots.
If you want to use SASS or custom variables, you may do so. You do not need to use them; it is your choice.
You do not need to do any code minification. This is not going into production at this point.
Accessibility Considerations
Implement landmark roles in cases where there is not an implicit role for the markup used.
Anchors have a 2px dotted outline, with a 5px outline offset. Most of the time this outline is #000. Watch the video to see all the focus visual changes / styling.
There is a 'Jump to main content' that is the first element in the page that gains focus; this is a within-page anchor that bypasses the masthead.
A fair amount of aria-label is used; these need to be descriptive.
Masthead (Top of Layout)
The large photo is best implemented as a background image, which allows you to set a descriptive aria-label.
Absolute positioning of the logo is a good idea. The logo's focus outline is #fff.
'What do you want to do in Greece?' is an h1. #00214F, 40px, 1.3 line-height, and 'Roboto Slab', serif.
How you place the h1 and the form below it is at your discretion; it is 320px from the top of the layout and occupies 90% of the layout width; it is centered.
The form elements need to be accessible and should reflect the most accurate type of form input for their purpose.
There are 10 pixels of space between the h1 and the form elements.
The input for data entry is 40px tall, 40% of the width of its containing element, with 10px left/right padding inside the input. Text is 16px, 1.3 line-height, and 'Roboto Slab', serif. When given focus its outline is 2px solid #000.
Once the 600px breakpoint is reached, the input's width changes from 40% to 70%.
The submit button has a #00214F background, #fff text color, and otherwise the same text settings as its fellow form element. The submit button also has 30px left/right padding. When given focus its outline is 2px solid #fff.
Greek History / Santorini / Monastic Splendor Section
Grid is used for this section.
Have the columns be auto-filling, ranging from a minimum of 250px to a maximum of 1fr. Gapping is 15px.
The spacing around the content is 80px above/below and 110px left/right, which drops to 50px left/right at the 1010px breakpoint, and 50px on all sides at the 600px breakpoint.
The section's background color is #EDF3EF.
The Greek History, Santorini, and Monastic Splendor text are h2. These are #666, 16px, 1.3 line-height, 700 font weight, and 'Roboto Slab', serif.
The paragraphs below the headings use the default font settings specified earlier. They have 20px spacing on their left and right sides. This, combined with centering the text, causes the text to wrap as shown.
Using anchors for the three photos is best, with the images as backgrounds. That allows aria-label to be used.
There is 25px of vertical space below the photos.
The plus icons can be regular images; because they are linked a descriptive aria-label can be provided.
Quotation Section
The best markup to use here is a blockquote.
Text is #666, 34px, 1.3 line-height, 700 font weight, and 'Arima Madurai', cursive.
'- Conde Nast' is 18px.
The quotation should occupy 80% of the layout width.
There is 80px of space above/below the text.
Explore Cafe Culture Section
This is a case where using a background image on a section permits the usage of aria-label, since sections are structural elements. That is the most accessible option that meets our layout needs.
'Explore Cafe Culture' is a linked h2. It has a background of #987B31. Text is #fff, 26px, 1.3 line-height, 400 font weight, and 'Arima Madurai', cursive.
The width of the heading is 200px. There is 20px of space above/below the heading text.
When hovered over or given focus, the heading background becomes #000.
Positioning the heading is not a bad approach. It is 220px from the top of the section and 80px from the right.
At the 600px breakpoint the h2 becomes horizontally centered.
Travel Smart Section
Grid is used for this section.
Use auto-filling columns that are at least 150px and at most 1fr, with a gap of 15px.
The spacing around the content is 80px above/below and 110px left/right, which drops to 50px left/right at the 1010px breakpoint, and 50px on all sides at the 600px breakpoint.
The section's background color is #448CCB.
'Travel Smart' is an h2. #fff, 34px, 1.3 line-height, 400 font weight, and 'Roboto Slab', serif.
There is 30px of vertical space below the h2.
Each of the columns is an anchor that has 40px of space on all sides. Text is #1D6BAE, 22px, and the background is #fff.
When those anchors are hovered over and receive focus, their background becomes #000 and their text becomes #fff.
When the 1010px breakpoint is reached, switch the grid to be two columns that are 1fr, with 30px gap. Rows are 100px tall. Anchor text loses its left/right spacing, as that space no longer serves a useful role in forcing text wrapping.
At the 600px breakpoint the grid is totally linearized, with 4 rows at 1fr width.
Footer Section
Grid is used for this section.
The third column (social media and copyright) is 1fr, the middle column is twice that, and the first column is 1.5 times the third column.
The spacing around the content is 80px above/below and 110px left/right, which drops to 50px left/right at the 1010px breakpoint, and 50px on all sides at the 600px breakpoint.
'Go Greek Tours' and 'Stay Up to Date' are h2. Text is #666, 22px, 1.3 line-height, 400 font weight, and 'Arima Madurai', cursive.
Headings have .5em of empty space below them.
In the first column the links have 1em of vertical space between them.
Those links use default font settings and are #666, switching to #000 when hovered over and given focus.
The middle column should again use the most appropriate form elements and make them accessible.
The email address input should occupy the available width of the column, have a 1px solid #000 border, and 5px of spacing within the input. When given focus, assign a 2px solid #000 outline.
The submit button is #fff on #448CCB, with 5px spacing above/below its text and 15px spacing to the left/right of its text. Be sure to assign a pointer cursor, as necessary. When hovered over and given focus, change the background to #000.
The social media and copyright are right-aligned. There is 40px of vertical space between them.
At the 800px breakpoint linearize the columns and set a 40px gap between the grid columns. Also left-align the social media and copyright at that point.
Printing
Consult the screenshot for what to hide.
All links are now #000.
Default font size is 12pt.
h1 is 28pt.
h2 is 18pt.
The anchors in the Travel Smart section have 20pt of vertical space below them.-->
