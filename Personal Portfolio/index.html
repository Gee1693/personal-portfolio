            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Hi! My name is Gary. I am an aspiring web developer who is very passionate about coding/programming 
                and have a desire to want to continue to learn and grow. I am always searching for more knowledge on 
                web developing and ways that I can get better.</p>

            <p>I originally went to school for medicine but later decided that it wasn't for me. I then switched to 
                psychology and quickly found out that although I like learning about psychology; I wasn't sure if I 
                wanted to do it as a career. Not really knowing what it was that I wanted to do it was then 
                that I came upon web developing and I decided to start by learning a bit about HTML and I was hooked. 
                I knew right there in that moment that web development was what I wanted to do. </p>
